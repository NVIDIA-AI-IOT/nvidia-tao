# Getting started with TAO (Train, Adapt, Optimize) with Google Colab

This repository contains Juptyer notebooks for users to try NVIDIA's TAO product for free on Google Colab before moving onto a scalable cloud instance.
We currently provide support for Conversational AI models based on Pytorch and Computer Vision models based on Tensorflow 1.15 and Pytorch.

## Tutorial ##

All the notebooks available in this repo can be run with Google Colab.
To run a tutorial:
Click the Colab link (see table below).
Follow the cells on the notebook for detailed instructions
